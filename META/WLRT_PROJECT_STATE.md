## 1. Project Overview

WLRT (Wave Liquidity Redistribution Theory) is a foundational theoretical framework
for describing financial market dynamics through the spatio-temporal evolution
of liquidity across price space.

The project is organized into clearly separated theoretical levels.
Strict version discipline and scope separation are core design principles.

## 2. Current Publication Status

### Publicly Available

- **GitHub:** WLRT v1.1 (public)
- **WLRT v1.2:** available as PDF (not yet consolidated as source)
- **WLRT v1.3 / v1.3.1:** applied extension (PDF, not public)
- **Technical Appendix v1.2:** PDF, pre-release
- **Scope & Limits document:** defines completeness of WLRT v1.x

### arXiv

- One submission exists
- Status: **pending endorsement**
- No published arXiv papers yet

### Internal Drafts

- **WLRT v2.0:** conceptual working draft only  
  - not finalized  
  - not canonical  
  - not to be submitted or referenced externally at this stage  

---

## 3. Accepted Strategic Decisions (LOCKED)

The following decisions are considered final unless explicitly revised
and recorded in this document.

1. WLRT v1.x (versions 1.0–1.3.1) is **ontologically and conceptually complete**
2. No further versions within v1.x will be created  
   *(no v1.4, v1.5, etc.)*
3. WLRT v1.x will be released as a **Consolidated Edition**
4. WLRT v2.0 represents a **new theoretical level**, not a correction of v1.x
5. v2.0 development is postponed until WLRT v1.x is endorsed and published
6. arXiv strategy:
   - single coherent submission
   - endorsement-first
   - replacement strategy preferred for future extensions

---

## 5. Publication Strategy

### arXiv

- Submit **WLRT v1.x Consolidated Edition** only
- Do not submit v2.0 separately
- Use endorsement once, not multiple parallel submissions

### GitHub

- Public canonical version = WLRT v1.x Consolidated
- v1.1 to be replaced or archived
- README must clearly explain scope and versioning

### Zenodo

- DOI to be created **after arXiv publication**
- Zenodo record will link:
  - GitHub repository
  - arXiv paper
  - ORCID

## 6. Rules of Collaboration

These rules govern all further work on WLRT.

1. Do not introduce new versions without explicit decision
2. Do not mix v1.x (foundational) and v2.0 (next-level) material
3. Always state whether a section is:
   - foundational
   - applied
   - future work
4. Prefer consolidation over expansion
5. If a decision is not written here, it is **not considered fixed**

---

## 7. Terminology Locks

The following definitions are fixed within WLRT v1.x:

- Liquidity = primary state variable
- Liquidity field = spatio-temporal field over price space
- Price = emergent observable, not a state variable
- Stability = bounded response of the liquidity field
- Stabilization ≠ price targeting
- Shareholder / anchoring case = structural, non-agent-based
- Order flow = external forcing, not causal primitive

---

## 8. Open Tasks (Near-Term)

1. Assemble WLRT v1.x Consolidated PDF
2. Assemble LaTeX source for v1.x Consolidated
3. Update GitHub repository structure and README
4. Prepare arXiv-ready submission package
5. Continue endorsement process using v1.x only

---

## 9. Long-Term Roadmap (Locked Sequence)

1. Endorsement and arXiv publication of WLRT v1.x
2. DOI issuance via Zenodo
3. Public stabilization of v1.x
4. Re-activation of WLRT v2.0 development
5. Empirical and agent-level extensions (future work)

## 10. Usage Rule

At the start of any new discussion thread, reference this document as:

> **“We work according to WLRT_PROJECT_STATE.md (canonical).”**
