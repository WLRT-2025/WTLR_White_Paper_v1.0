# WLRT — Wave Liquidity Redistribution Theory  
## White Paper v1.0

This repository contains the official **WLRT White Paper v1.0**, presenting the Wave Liquidity Redistribution Theory — a theoretical framework for modeling financial market dynamics through liquidity redistribution in price space.

WLRT treats price as a secondary observable that emerges from internal liquidity dynamics, rather than as a primary driver of market behavior.

## Abstract (Short)

WLRT models financial markets as structured dynamical systems governed by conservation, propagation, and dissipation of liquidity.  
Observed price dynamics emerge from wave-like redistribution of liquidity across price levels.  \
The theory focuses on structural market behavior rather than prediction or trading signals.

## Scope

WLRT is intended as:

- a theoretical research framework,
- a geometric and causal model of market dynamics,
- a basis for further analytical and empirical exploration.

WLRT is **not** intended for:

- price prediction,
- trading signal generation,
- investment recommendations.

## Key Concepts

- price as an observable projection of liquidity state,
- liquidity density and liquidity flux,
- wave-like redistribution in price space,
- market regimes as solution classes,
- interpretation of GRID trading systems as wave resonators.

## Status

- Version: **1.0**
- Type: Research White Paper
- Maturity: Initial formal formulation
- Stability: Definitions and core equations fixed

Future versions may extend the model to:
- nonlinear dynamics,
- adaptive price-space geometry,
- empirical validation.
