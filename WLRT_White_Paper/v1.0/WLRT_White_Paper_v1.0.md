## Abstract
This white paper presents the Wave Liquidity Redistribution Theory (WLRT), a universal market model in which observed price dynamics emerge from wave-like redistribution of liquidity across price space.  \
Financial markets are treated as structured dynamical systems governed by conservation, propagation, and dissipation of liquidity. Price is defined as a secondary observable derived from the state of the liquidity field rather than as a primary driver.
## 1. Motivation
Most existing market models focus on price trajectories, indicators, or agent behavior. Such approaches describe market outcomes but rarely address price formation itself.  \
WLRT proposes a different modeling layer:
- price is not a fundamental variable;
- price is an observable projection of internal liquidity dynamics.  \
This document introduces the minimal linear formulation of the theory.
## 2. Price Space Representation
The market is represented as a one-dimensional price space P:  
- the space is divided into discrete price sectors;
- each sector contains an amount of effective liquidity;
- liquidity may redistribute between neighboring sectors.  \
The geometry of price space is fixed and uniform in this version.
## 3. Fundamental Quantities
The model introduces the following quantities:
- rho(P,t): liquidity density;
- grad rho: liquidity gradient;
- J(P,t): liquidity flux;
- c: characteristic redistribution speed;
- gamma: dissipation (market friction);
- S(P,t): external liquidity sources and sinks.  \
Causal structure: liquidity gradient -> liquidity flux -> liquidity waves -> observed price.
## 4. Definition of Price
Observed price is defined as the liquidity-weighted center of the system:  \
P(t) = integral(P * rho(P,t) dP) / integral(rho(P,t) dP).  \
Price reflects the instantaneous configuration of the liquidity field and does not represent discrete transactions.
## 5. Liquidity Dynamics
Liquidity redistribution is described by a damped wave equation:  \
d2 rho / dt2 + gamma * d rho / dt = c^2 * d2 rho / dP2 + dS / dt.  \
This equation captures:
- inertia of liquidity;
- propagation across price levels;
- and dissipation due to friction and execution costs.
## 6. Market Regimes
Different classes of solutions correspond to common market regimes: 
- standing waves correspond to range-bound markets;
- traveling waves to directional trends;
- critical damping to flat or inactive markets;
- and impulse responses to news-driven movements.  \
Regime transitions arise from changes in boundary conditions or external inputs.
## 7. Conservation Properties
In the absence of external sources S:
- total liquidity is conserved;
- local inflows equal local outflows;
- and system behavior is scale-invariant.  \
Violations of conservation indicate external intervention.
## 8. Interpretation of Volatility
Volatility corresponds to the amplitude of liquidity oscillations and the intensity of redistribution processes. High volatility reflects strong internal dynamics rather than randomness or noise.
## 9. GRID Trading Systems
A GRID trading system is interpreted as a discrete wave resonator:
- grid boundaries create standing liquidity waves;
- repeated reflections generate dissipation;
- and profit arises from energy loss during oscillations.  \
GRID systems are effective only in oscillatory regimes.
## 10. Failure Conditions of GRID Systems
GRID systems fail when:
- directional liquidity flux dominates;
- standing waves collapse;
- or boundary conditions are violated.  \
Failure represents a regime transition rather than an execution error.
## 11. Scope and Non-Claims
WLRT does not predict exact prices, does not rely on indicators, and does not assume rational or optimal agents. The theory models structural dynamics rather than forecasts.
## 12. Model Assumptions and Limitations
WLRT:
- assumes linear liquidity response;
- fixed price-space geometry;
- and passive liquidity behavior.  \
These assumptions define the scope of applicability.
## 13. Conclusion
WLRT provides a minimal, causal, and geometric framework for understanding market dynamics through liquidity redistribution. Price emerges as a secondary observable of the system's internal state.
