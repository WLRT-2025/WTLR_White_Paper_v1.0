## Project State and Versioning

The Wave Liquidity Redistribution Theory (WLRT) project follows a strict versioning
and scope discipline.

The canonical project state, accepted strategic decisions, version structure,
and collaboration rules are defined in:
## Canonical Papers (WLRT v1.x)

- 📄 [WLRT v1.x (English, consolidated)](./WLRT_v1.x_consolidated.pdf)
- 📄 [WLRT v1.x (Russian, consolidated)](./WLRT_v1.x_consolidated_RU.pdf)
**/META/WLRT_PROJECT_STATE.md**

This document is the single source of truth for:
- current publication status,
- accepted version boundaries,
- consolidation strategy for WLRT v1.x,
- future development roadmap.

Any work on WLRT should be consistent with the project state defined there.
## Overview

Wave Liquidity Redistribution Theory (WLRT) is a theoretical framework for analyzing
financial market dynamics through the spatial and temporal evolution of liquidity
across price space.

Unlike price-centric or equilibrium-based models, WLRT treats liquidity as the
primary state variable and interprets price movements as emergent outcomes driven
by liquidity gradients, propagation, concentration, and dissipation.

The theory aims to provide a unified liquidity-based description of market regimes
such as trends, consolidations, volatility expansions, and abrupt transitions.

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as the primary public archive of WLRT manuscripts, including
released versions, extended developments, and technical appendices.

The repository is versioned and organized to preserve the historical evolution of
the theory while allowing ongoing extensions.

## Versions and Status

- **v1.1** — Initial public release  
  GitHub release created to obtain DOI via Zenodo.  
  Status: under review / processing on Zenodo and SSRN.

- **v1.2** — Stable reference version (pre-release)  
  Revised and extended version intended as the main reference manuscript once
  the initial publication process is completed.

- **v1.3** — Current extended development version  
  Ongoing development including hidden liquidity, global liquidity dynamics,
  and additional theoretical extensions.

Until the publication process is completed, **v1.1 remains the official citable
version**.
