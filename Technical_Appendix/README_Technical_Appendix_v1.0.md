# README WLRT_Technical_Appendix_v1.0
This repository contains the **WLRT Technical Appendix v1.0**
, a supplementary document
to the **WLRT — Wave Liquidity Redistribution Theory, White Paper v1.0**  \
The Technical Appendix provides formal definitions, mathematical clarifications, and explicit
assumptions underlying the WLRT framework. It is intended to support the core white paper
by making its technical foundations transparent and well-defined.
## Purpose of the Technical Appendix
The Technical Appendix is designed to:
- provide formal mathematical clarification of key concepts introduced in the White Paper,
- explicitly state assumptions, axioms, and constraints used implicitly in the core text,
- define the limits of validity of the presented models,
- outline directions for future technical extensions without altering the conceptual integrity of
WLRT v1.0.  \
This document **does not introduce new theoretical claims** and should be read in
conjunction with the White Paper.
## Relation to White Paper
- Primary document: **WLRT — White Paper v1.0**
- Role of this appendix: **Supplementary technical formalization**
- Conceptual scope: strictly aligned with the White Paper
- Theory status: unchanged  \
  All definitions and formulations in this appendix are derived from and consistent with the
White Paper, particularly its theoretical and mathematical sections.

## Topics Covered
The Technical Appendix includes:
- formal definitions of market liquidity and liquidity distribution,
- conservation-based formulation of liquidity redistribution,
- definition and properties of liquidity waves,
- axioms and assumptions of the WLRT framework,
- mathematical evolution equations,
- constraints and limits of the model,
- notes on planned future technical extensions.
## Status
- Version: **1.0**
- Document type: Technical Appendix
- Role: Supplementary to White Paper
- Stability: Definitions, axioms, and equations fixed for v1.0  \
Future versions may extend the mathematical framework while preserving the core axioms
of WLRT.
